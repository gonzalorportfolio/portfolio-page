            I was born in Puebla, Mexico, and raised in South Brooklyn (still repping Brooklyn today). 
            My journey started as a music teacher and administrator before I transitioned into 
            computer science education in 2017. Since then, I’ve dedicated myself to making 
            technology approachable, inclusive, and empowering for learners from all backgrounds.

          <br />
          <p className="about-text">
            Currently, I serve as the <strong>Senior Lead Instructor</strong> at 
            <a style={{ color: "inherit", textDecoration: "none" }} href="https://www.marcylabschool.org/people/gonzalo-romero" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> The Marcy Lab School</a>, 
            where I guide fellows in software engineering. I specialize in breaking down complex concepts, 
            fostering inclusive learning spaces, and supporting the next generation of builders to see 
            themselves in tech.

          <p className="about-text">
            My mission is simple: <strong>expand access to software engineering education</strong> 
            for underrepresented learners. I believe in making tech joyful, relevant, and accessible, 
            and I’m committed to helping students gain both the technical skills and the confidence 
            to thrive in the industry.

            When I’m not teaching or coding, you’ll find me ice skating, playing hockey, 
            skateboarding, curating eclectic playlists (rap → punk → screamo → EDM), 
            or playing a good game of chess. No matter the arena, I bring the same energy: 
            curiosity, creativity, and a drive to keep learning.
