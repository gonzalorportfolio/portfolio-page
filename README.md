## Changelog

### v1.0.10

- **Enhanced Server Startup Logging:**  
  The logger now provides a clear, formatted, and informative output when the server starts, including environment, version, port, and a direct local URL.

- **Project Structure Improvements:**  
  - **Middleware Restructured:**  
    All middleware functions (such as request logging) are now organized under the `middleware/` directory for better maintainability.
  - **Utility Functions Modularized:**  
    Utility functions (like server health checks and logging) have been moved to a dedicated `utils/` directory, making the codebase cleaner and easier to extend.
